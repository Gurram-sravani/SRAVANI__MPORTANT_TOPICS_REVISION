"If input is an adjacency matrix → stay with matrix.
Adjacency list helps only when input is sparse or edge-based"	Adjacency lists are efficient for sparse, edge-based graphs, 
while adjacency matrices are suitable for dense graphs or matrix-based inputs

Edges based Representation : You are given a list of edges… ( " edges = [[u, v], [x, y], …]” )
Sparse vs Dense (WHAT the graph actually looks like): This is about how many edges exist in reality.
Maximum possible edges , For n nodes: Max edges ≈ n²
Sparse graph : Very few edges compared to n²
Dense graph: Number of edges is close to n²

Input Format	Graph Nature	Typical Choice
Edge-based	Sparse	Adjacency list
Matrix-based	Dense	Adjacency matrix
Matrix-based	Sparse	Still matrix (input forces it)
Edge-based	Dense	Adjacency list (still better)

| Problem   | Matrix cell means         | Node is |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| Islands   | A place you can stand on  | `(r,c)` |
| Provinces | A yes/no about connection | `i`     |

Be careful and Understand when you are calling dfs for above problems, make sure it representa a relationship or real node.

If a matrix cell represents a real object, DFS uses (r,c).
If a matrix cell represents a relationship, DFS uses the node index.

Case 1: Number of Islands
What does the matrix represent -  Each cell (r,c) IS a real thing - It is a land tile or water tile
Entity (node) = cell (r,c)

Case 2: Number of Provinces
What does the matrix represent - The matrix does NOT represent places. It represents connections between cities
City i is the real thing - (i,j) is just information about a connection
Entity (node) = city i  ***(NOT (i,j))****


*****visited=set() ***** because a set is unordered so you dont care which order nodes were visited - only whether they visited or not.
