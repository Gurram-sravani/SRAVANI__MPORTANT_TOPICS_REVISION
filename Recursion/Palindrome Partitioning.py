Substring is a contigous , cannot skip any index, must be defind as [start:end+1]  => Substring logic = choose start and end
subsequence  Does NOT need to be contiguous, can skip index, keep original order => Subsequence logic = take / skip pattern

# Partitioning by every index for every string (so you need to do the partition for a string from start to end of the string).
