In this Problem , They have given that "A node can only appear in the sequence at most once" - DONT GET CONFUSION HERE WITH GRAPH PATHS -
“In graphs path node – we don’t get repeated value 1-2-3-1 – it’s wrong path”.
  
But the difference is:

In a tree, you can’t even form that path
In a graph, you can form it, so you must block it

This path is allowed in both:
2 → 1 → 2
As long as:They are different nodes. Not the same object
Tree example:
    1
   / \
  2   2
Graph example:

2a — 1 — 2b

Same values, different nodes → valid path.

''' Tree (graph-theory definition):
A graph G is a tree iff:
G is connected
G has no cycles
Equivalently: there is exactly one simple path between every pair of nodes

👉 Unique path is the key property.

🌲 Binary Tree (data-structure definition)

A binary tree is a special kind of graph where:
Each node has at most one parent
Each node has 0, 1, or 2 children
Left and right subtrees are disjoint
Each node object appears exactly once in the structure '''

Case 1: Valid tree (different objects)
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

A1 = Node("A1")
B1 = Node("B1")
B2 = Node("B2")

A1.left = B1
A1.right = B2

Properties:
All objects are different
Each node has one parent max
Exactly one path between any two nodes

Example paths:
B1 → A1 → B2
✅ This is a tree

#Case 2: Same object used twice (NO cycle yet!)
A1 = Node("A1")
B2 = Node("B2")

A1.left = B2
A1.right = B2   # same object

Graph structure:
   A1
  /  \
 B2  B2   (same object)

Important truth 🚨

❌ This is NOT a tree

❌ But it also does NOT contain a cycle

Why not a tree?

Because:

There are two different paths from A1 to B2
left edge
right edge
So the “exactly one path between nodes” rule is broken.

Why no cycle?
A cycle means:
node → ... → same node again
That does not happen here.
✔ This structure is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
❌ Not a tree

Case 3: Same object, TWO parents (still no cycle)
A1 = Node("A1")
B1 = Node("B1")
B2 = Node("B2")

A1.left = B2
B1.right = B2   # B2 has two parents

Graph:

A1 → B2 ← B1

Properties:
B2 has two parents

Two distinct paths exist between some nodes
No node loops back to itself
❌ Not a tree
❌ Still no cycle
✔ DAG

Case 4: SAME object + backward reference (NOW it is a cycle)
A1 = Node("A1")
B1 = Node("B1")

A1.left = B1
B1.left = A1   # cycle


Graph:

A1 → B1
 ↑     |
 └─────┘

Properties:

A cycle exists
Infinite traversal possible
Multiple paths between nodes

❌ Not a tree
❌ Not acyclic
✔ General graph
